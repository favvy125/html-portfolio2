<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm Favour Chisom Ugwuzor, an aspiring web developer based in Berlin, Germany. I'm currently studying Computer Science and Digitisation while learning the ins and outs of modern web development.
  My journey into tech started with a deep curiosity about how websites work and now, I'm actively building that knowledge into real world skills. I'm especially interested in frontend development, where creativity meets code, but I'm also exploring backend technologies to become a well-rounded full-stack developer.
</p>

<p>Right now, I'm learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and diving into frameworks and tools like React and Git. I enjoy building responsive, user-friendly websites and turning ideas into interactive experiences.</p>

<p>This portfolio is a space to share my progress and showcase the projects I have been working on. Whether it's a small personal project or a course assignment, each one represents a step in my learning journey and I'm excited to keep growing.</p>
<p>Thanks for stopping by! Feel free to check out my projects below and connect with me if you'd like to chat or collaborate.</p>
